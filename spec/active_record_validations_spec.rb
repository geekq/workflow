  # Transition based validation
  # ---------------------------
  # If you are using ActiveRecord you might want to define different validations
  # for different transitions. There is a `validates_presence_of` hook that let's
  # you specify the attributes that need to be present for an successful transition.
  # If the object is not valid at the end of the transition event the transition
  # is halted and a TransitionHaltedError exception is thrown.
  #
  # Here is a sample that illustrates how to use the presence validation:
  # (use case suggested by http://github.com/southdesign)
  class ActiveRecordArticle < ActiveRecord::Base
