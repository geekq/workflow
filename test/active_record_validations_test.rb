# Transition based validation
# ---------------------------
# If you are using ActiveRecord you might want to define different validations
# for different transitions. There is a `validates_presence_of` hook that let's
# you specify the attributes that need to be present for an successful transition.
# If the object is not valid at the end of the transition event the transition
# is halted and a TransitionHaltedError exception is thrown.
#
# Here is a sample that illustrates how to use the presence validation:
# (use case suggested by http://github.com/southdesign)
class ActiveRecordArticle < ActiveRecord::Base
