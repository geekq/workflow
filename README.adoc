What is workflow?
-----------------

Workflow is a finite-state-machine-inspired API for modeling and
interacting with what we tend to refer to as 'workflow'.

A lot of business modeling tends to involve workflow-like concepts, and
the aim of this library is to make the expression of these concepts as
clear as possible, using similar terminology as found in state machine
theory.

So, a workflow has a state. It can only be in one state at a time. When
a workflow changes state, we call that a transition. Transitions occur
on an event, so events cause transitions to occur. Additionally, when an
event fires, other arbitrary code can be executed, we call those actions.
So any given state has a bunch of events, any event in a state causes a
transition to another state and potentially causes code to be executed
(an action). We can hook into states when they are entered, and exited
from, and we can cause transitions to fail (guards), and we can hook in
to every transition that occurs ever for whatever reason we can come up
with.

Now, all that's a mouthful, but we'll demonstrate the API bit by bit
with a real-ish world example.

Let's say we're modeling article submission from journalists. An article
is written, then submitted. When it's submitted, it's awaiting review.
Someone reviews the article, and then either accepts or rejects it.
Here is the expression of this workflow using the API:

    class Article
      include Workflow
      workflow do
        state :new do
          event :submit, :transitions_to => :awaiting_review
        end
        state :awaiting_review do
          event :review, :transitions_to => :being_reviewed
        end
        state :being_reviewed do
          event :accept, :transitions_to => :accepted
          event :reject, :transitions_to => :rejected
        end
        state :accepted
        state :rejected
      end
    end

Nice, isn't it!

Note: the first state in the definition (`:new` in the example, but you
can name it as you wish) is used as the initial state - newly created
objects start their life cycle in that state.

Let's create an article instance and check in which state it is:

    article = Article.new
    article.accepted? # => false
    article.new? # => true

You can also access the whole `current_state` object including the list
of possible events and other meta information:

    article.current_state
    => #<Workflow::State:0x7f1e3d6731f0 @events={
      :submit=>#<Workflow::Event:0x7f1e3d6730d8 @action=nil,
        @transitions_to=:awaiting_review, @name=:submit, @meta={}>},
      name:new, meta{}

You can also check, whether a state comes before or after another state (by the
order they were defined):

    article.current_state
    => being_reviewed
    article.current_state < :accepted
    => true
    article.current_state >= :accepted
    => false
    article.current_state.between? :awaiting_review, :rejected
    => true

Now we can call the submit event, which transitions to the
<tt>:awaiting_review</tt> state:

    article.submit!
    article.awaiting_review? # => true

Events are actually instance methods on a workflow, and depending on the
state you're in, you'll have a different set of events used to
transition to other states.

It is also easy to check, if a certain transition is possible from the
current state . `article.can_submit?` checks if there is a `:submit`
event (transition) defined for the current state.


Getting started
---------------

=== Installation

    gem install workflow

**Important**: If you're interested in graphing your workflow state machine, you will also need to
install the `activesupport` and `ruby-graphviz` gems.

Versions up to and including 1.0.0 are also available as a single file download -
[lib/workflow.rb file](https://github.com/geekq/workflow/blob/v1.0.0/lib/workflow.rb).


=== Examples

After installation or downloading the library you can easily try out
all the example code from this README in irb.

    $ irb
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'workflow'

Now just copy and paste the source code from the beginning of this README
file snippet by snippet and observe the output.


### Transition event handler

The best way is to use convention over configuration and to define a
method with the same name as the event. Then it is automatically invoked
when event is raised. For the Article workflow defined earlier it would
be:

    class Article
      def reject
        puts 'sending email to the author explaining the reason...'
      end
    end

`article.review!; article.reject!` will cause state transition to
`being_reviewed` state, persist the new state (if integrated with
ActiveRecord), invoke this user defined `reject` method and finally
persist the `rejected` state.

Note: on successful transition from one state to another the workflow
gem immediately persists the new workflow state with `update_column()`,
bypassing any ActiveRecord callbacks including `updated_at` update.
This way it is possible to deal with the validation and to save the
pending changes to a record at some later point instead of the moment
when transition occurs.

You can also define event handler accepting/requiring additional
arguments:

    class Article
      def review(reviewer = '')
        puts "[#{reviewer}] is now reviewing the article"
      end
    end

    article2 = Article.new
    article2.submit!
    article2.review!('Homer Simpson') # => [Homer Simpson] is now reviewing the article


Alternative way is to use a block (only recommended for short event
implementation without further code nesting):

    event :review, :transitions_to => :being_reviewed do |reviewer|
      # store the reviewer
    end

We've noticed, that mixing the list of events and states with the blocks
invoked for particular transitions leads to a bumpy and poorly readable code
due to a deep nesting. We tried (and dismissed) lambdas for this. Eventually
we decided to invoke an optional user defined callback method with the same
name as the event (convention over configuration) as explained before.

State persistence
-----------------

=== ActiveRecord

Note: Workflow 2.0 is a major refactoring for the `worklow` library.
If your application suddenly breaks after the workflow 2.0 release, you've
probably got your Gemfile wrong ;-). workflow uses
https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning[semantic versioning].
For highest compatibility please reference the desired major+minor version.

Note on ActiveRecord/Rails 4.\*, 5.\* Support:

Since integration with ActiveRecord makes over 90% of the issues and
maintenance effort, and also to allow for an independent (faster) release cycle
for Rails support, starting with workflow **version 2.0** in January 2019 the
support for ActiveRecord (4.\*, 5.\* and newer) has been extracted into a separate
gem. Read at
https://github.com/geekq/workflow-activerecord[workflow-activerecord], how to
include the right gem.

To use legacy built-in ActiveRecord 2.3 - 4.* support, reference Workflow 1.2 in
your Gemfile:

    gem 'workflow', '~> 1.2'


=== Custom workflow state persistence

If you do not use a relational database and ActiveRecord, you can still
integrate the workflow very easily. To implement persistence you just
need to override `load_workflow_state` and
`persist_workflow_state(new_value)` methods. Next section contains an example for
using CouchDB, a document oriented database.

http://tim.lossen.de/[Tim Lossen] implemented support
for http://github.com/tlossen/remodel[remodel] / http://github.com/antirez/redis[redis]
key-value store.

=== Integration with CouchDB

We are using the compact http://github.com/geekq/couchtiny[couchtiny library]
here. But the implementation would look similar for the popular
couchrest library.

    require 'couchtiny'
    require 'couchtiny/document'
    require 'workflow'

    class User < CouchTiny::Document
      include Workflow
      workflow do
        state :submitted do
          event :activate_via_link, :transitions_to => :proved_email
        end
        state :proved_email
      end

      def load_workflow_state
        self[:workflow_state]
      end

      def persist_workflow_state(new_value)
        self[:workflow_state] = new_value
        save!
      end
    end

Please also have a look at
http://github.com/geekq/workflow/blob/develop/test/couchtiny_example.rb[the full source code].


=== Adapters to support other databases

I get a lot of requests to integrate persistence support for different
databases, object-relational adapters, column stores, document
databases.

To enable highest possible quality, avoid too many dependencies and to
avoid unneeded maintenance burden on the `workflow` core it is best to
implement such support as a separate gem.

Only support for the ActiveRecord will remain for the foreseeable
future. So Rails beginners can expect `workflow` to work with Rails out
of the box. Other already included adapters stay for a while but should
be extracted to separate gems.

If you want to implement support for your favorite ORM mapper or your
favorite NoSQL database, you just need to implement a module which
overrides the persistence methods `load_workflow_state` and
`persist_workflow_state`. Example:

    module Workflow
      module SuperCoolDb
        module InstanceMethods
          def load_workflow_state
            # Load and return the workflow_state from some storage.
            # You can use self.class.workflow_column configuration.
          end

          def persist_workflow_state(new_value)
            # save the new_value workflow state
          end
        end

        module ClassMethods
          # class methods of your adapter go here
        end

        def self.included(klass)
          klass.send :include, InstanceMethods
          klass.extend ClassMethods
        end
      end
    end

The user of the adapter can use it then as:

    class Article
      include Workflow
      include Workflow:SuperCoolDb
      workflow do
        state :submitted
        # ...
      end
    end

I can then link to your implementation from this README. Please let me
also know, if you need any interface beyond `load_workflow_state` and
`persist_workflow_state` methods to implement an adapter for your
favorite database.

Advanced usage
--------------

### Accessing your workflow specification

You can easily reflect on workflow specification programmatically - for
the whole class or for the current object. Examples:

    article2.current_state.events # lists possible events from here
    article2.current_state.events[:reject].transitions_to # => :rejected

    Article.workflow_spec.states.keys
    #=> [:rejected, :awaiting_review, :being_reviewed, :accepted, :new]

    Article.workflow_spec.state_names
    #=> [:rejected, :awaiting_review, :being_reviewed, :accepted, :new]

    # list all events for all states
    Article.workflow_spec.states.values.collect &:events


You can also store and later retrieve additional meta data for every
state and every event:

    class MyProcess
      include Workflow
      workflow do
        state :main, :meta => {:importance => 8}
        state :supplemental, :meta => {:importance => 1}
      end
    end
    puts MyProcess.workflow_spec.states[:supplemental].meta[:importance] # => 1

The workflow library itself uses this feature to tweak the graphical
representation of the workflow. See below.


### Conditional event transitions

Conditions can be a "method name symbol" with a corresponding instance method, a `proc` or `lambda` which are added to events, like so:

    state :off
      event :turn_on, :transition_to => :on,
                      :if => :sufficient_battery_level?

      event :turn_on, :transition_to => :low_battery,
                      :if => proc { |device| device.battery_level > 0 }
    end

    # corresponding instance method
    def sufficient_battery_level?
      battery_level > 10
    end

When calling a `device.can_<fire_event>?` check, or attempting a `device.<event>!`, each event is checked in turn:

* With no `:if` check, proceed as usual.
* If an `:if` check is present, proceed if it evaluates to true, or drop to the next event.
* If you've run out of events to check (eg. `battery_level == 0`), then the transition isn't possible.


### Advanced transition hooks

#### on_entry/on_exit

We already had a look at the declaring callbacks for particular workflow
events. If you would like to react to all transitions to/from the same state
in the same way you can use the on_entry/on_exit hooks. You can either define it
with a block inside the workflow definition or through naming
convention, e.g. for the state :pending just define the method
`on_pending_exit(new_state, event, *args)` somewhere in your class.

#### on_transition

If you want to be informed about everything happening everywhere, e.g. for
logging then you can use the universal `on_transition` hook:

    workflow do
      state :one do
        event :increment, :transitions_to => :two
      end
      state :two
      on_transition do |from, to, triggering_event, *event_args|
        Log.info "#{from} -> #{to}"
      end
    end

#### on_error

If you want to do custom exception handling internal to workflow, you can define an `on_error` hook in your workflow.
For example:

    workflow do
      state :first do
        event :forward, :transitions_to => :second
      end
      state :second

      on_error do |error, from, to, event, *args|
        Log.info "Exception(#error.class) on #{from} -> #{to}"
      end
    end

If forward! results in an exception, `on_error` is invoked and the workflow stays in a 'first' state.  This capability
is particularly useful if your errors are transient and you want to queue up a job to retry in the future without
affecting the existing workflow state.

### Guards

If you want to halt the transition conditionally, you can just raise an
exception in your [transition event handler](#transition_event_handler).
There is a helper called `halt!`, which raises the
Workflow::TransitionHalted exception. You can provide an additional
`halted_because` parameter.

    def reject(reason)
      halt! 'We do not reject articles unless the reason is important' \
        unless reason =~ /important/i
    end

The traditional `halt` (without the exclamation mark) is still supported
too. This just prevents the state change without raising an
exception.

You can check `halted?` and `halted_because` values later.

### Hook order

The whole event sequence is as follows:

    * before_transition
    * event specific action
    * on_transition (if action did not halt)
    * on_exit
    * PERSIST WORKFLOW STATE, i.e. transition
    * on_entry
    * after_transition


Documenting with diagrams
-------------------------

You can generate a graphical representation of the workflow for
a particular class for documentation purposes.
Use `Workflow::create_workflow_diagram(class)` in your rake task like:

    namespace :doc do
      desc "Generate a workflow graph for a model passed e.g. as 'MODEL=Order'."
      task :workflow => :environment do
        require 'workflow/draw'
        Workflow::Draw::workflow_diagram(ENV['MODEL'].constantize)
      end
    end
